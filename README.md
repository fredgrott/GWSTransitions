Soft fork of the transitions-everywhere library as it usually bad form to
create libraries with the android namespace as changes in the support libraries
could potential walk all-over that library with the android namespace.

# About Fred Grott/GWS

Fred Grott(GrottWorkShop) is a mobile developer specializing in android and focusing
on completing consulting contracts for porting iPhone applications to android and
MVPs for start-ups in the Greater ChicagoLand area. Part of Fred Grott(GWS) focus is
producing fast android application prototypes in an agile way. Ways to contact are
via email listed on the github profile page as I do not obfuscate my email when I
do github commits.

## Recruiter Warning

If you are a recruiter do not play the spam games of spamming my email or GoogleVoice number as
no recruiter has anything to sell me as those like me in that they are computer software
engineer polyglot have no need to play the broken HR hiring game as we plot our own unique course.
And if you are a start-up founder that does their own mobile dev recruiting instead of out-sourcing
it than you might know what I am looking for or seeking.

## What I Want?

If you are a startup in the Northwest Indiana or Chicago and are in-fact seeking a Senior Android Engineer
that would be able to create either an android application from scratch or port an iOS app to android that
is testable and maintainable and has a user interface that seduces the mobile device user than you are on-the-road
to knowing what I might want. Even better if you can match my work-remote paid weekly requirements.
And that conversation usually starts with a paid meal at my location.
